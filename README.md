# variablefiy
`variablefiy` is a web app that can extract color from css and define it as variables.
Try it on [my github pages](https://berniehuang2008.github.io/variablefiy/main.html)

For some developers who writes css by hand, colors are often dispersed everywhere.
However, if you want to change a theme or change a color, you need to search mountains of codes to find the right place.

Now, `variablefiy` can help you. It can search your code and automatically generate variables.
You can also rename your variable or see detailed codes in a beautiful table.
