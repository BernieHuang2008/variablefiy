# variablefiy
`variablefiy` is a web app that can extract color from css and define it as variables.

For some developers who writes css by hand, colors are often dispersed everywhere.
However, if you want to change a theme or change a color, you need to search mountains of codes to find the right place.

Now, `variablefiy` can help you. It can search your code and automatically generate variables.
You can also rename your variable or see detailed codes in a beautiful table.
